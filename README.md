# One-way OS-independent folder synchronizer

## Description

Once launched, the app should be configured with the path of a source and a replica folder, the path of a log file where the file operations will be recorded, as well as a synchronization time interval (in seconds).

## Scripts
* `make build`: launch the folder synchronization app in the console
* `make test`: launch Pytest suite(s) - set the specific test variables first (see test modules)
